    <h1>📝 $DEVOPS — Whitepaper v0.1</h1>

    <h2>🧠 Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Dev culture meets degen.</strong><br>
    <strong>Pipelines meet moon missions.</strong></p>
    <p>$DEVOPS is the first memecoin designed to bring real DevOps energy into the crypto world. It’s where APIs, automation, and innovation collide with meme culture and community momentum.</p>

    <h2>🌐 Vision</h2>
    <p>$DEVOPS merges the creativity and speed of DevOps engineers with the viral power of memecoins. This is a space for builders, hackers, and innovators who know their way around APIs and love creating cool shit.</p>

    <h2>🧰 Core Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🛠 <strong>Innovation First</strong> — $DEVOPS is built by people who ship fast.</li>
      <li>🧠 <strong>DevOps Culture</strong> — CI/CD, automation, and hacking are in our DNA.</li>
      <li>🚀 <strong>Meme Momentum</strong> — Fun, hype, and community are the fuel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💰 Tokenomics</h2>
    <p>Details will be released closer to launch. The focus will be on fair distribution, community involvement, and builder incentives — no VC allocations.</p>
